## Title: 
Team Profile Generator

## Description:
This Team Profile Generator is for the Module 10 Challenge. I first set up my main class of Employees and then extended the classes of Manager, Intern and Engineer. I tested my classes and then built the index.js page which then transferred to the table.html page. 

## Installation:


## Usage:
This project will allow users to input and add employees into the profile generator by name, id, and email. The manager will also list officenumber, the intern will list school and the engineer will list github name.
